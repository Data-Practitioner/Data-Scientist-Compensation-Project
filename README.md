# Data Scientist Compensation Project

## 1. Project Overview
This project is to predict the compensation of a Data Scientist using Stack Overflow data. Also, finding out which variables contribute to Data Scientist’s compensation.

### 1.1. Problem Statement
An HR company wants to understand how much Data Scientists can get compensated in the USA based on factors such as education, seniority, location (USA), experience, and technical knowledge.

### 1.2. Solution
Build a web application that compares actual vs predicted compensation based on factors such as education, seniority, location (USA), experience, and technical knowledge.

### 1.3. Tools
Data Storage - Excel <br>
Data Mining, Analysis, and Transform - Python (Pandas & Numpy) <br>
Data Science/ML - Python (Sklearn, Feature Engine, Scipy, Feature Tools, Statsmodel, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Catboost) <br>
Data Visualization - Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn)<br>
Web Application - Python (Streamlit) <br>
Application Hosting - Github <br>

### 1.4. Technical Skills
Data Analysis <br>
Data Mining <br>
Data Transformation <br>
Data Visualization <br>
Programming (Python) <br>
ML Deployment <br>
Web Application <br>
Data Storytelling <br>
Machine Learning <br>

### 1.5. End to End Process Flowchart

## 2. Hypothesis Generation
Hypothesis generation is broken into three different categories.

**Demographic**

Is education a good estimate for predicting salary? <br>
Does a certain education level provide a better salary? <br>
Is seniority_level a good estimate for predicting salary? <br>
Does a certain seniority_level provide a better salary? <br>
Does age impact salary? <br>

**Geographic**

Is state_code a good estimate for predicting salary? <br>
Does a certain state provide a better salary? <br>

**Psychographic**

Does one knowing a programming language provide a better salary? <br>
Does one knowing SQL provide a better salary? <br>
Does one knowing the command line provide a better salary? <br>
Does one knowing cloud computing platform provide a better salary? <br>

## 3. Data Source
Data is collected from Stack Overflow Survey 2021 data.
